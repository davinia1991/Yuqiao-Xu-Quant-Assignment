```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
z <- read.lp("PP_1 Yuqiao Xu.lp")
z
```
this is the for the first part of the question , we solve for objective and variables , subject to constraints 
```{r}
solve(z)
get.objective (z)
```
```{r}
get.variables(z)
```
```{r}
get.constraints(z)
```

for part 4 , we modifgy the model and solve for teh objective , variabkes subject to new constraints .

```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
x <- read.lp("PP_4A Yuqiao Xu.lp")
x
```
model name :
   a linear program with 12 decision variables and 8 constraints 
   
Now, we solve for the problem 
```{r}
solve(x)
get.objective (x)
```
```{r}
get.constraints(x)
```
```{r}
get.variables(x)
```


```{r}
library("lpSolveAPI")
y <- read.lp("PP_5A Yuqiao Xu.lp")
y
```
now , we solve the problem 5 with new constraints and objective function 
```{r}
solve(y)
get.objective(y)
```
```{r}
get.constraints(y)
```
```{r}
get.variables(y)
```
```
